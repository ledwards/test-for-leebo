/**
 * CommonBelt
 *
 * A belt that provides common cards for booster packs using static belt assignments.
 *
 * MANUFACTURING PRINCIPLE:
 * We mimic a physical card manufacturing process. The belt is a cyclic conveyor
 * that dispenses cards in order. We do NOT use post-hoc fixes or manual corrections.
 * Instead, we ensure the belt is constructed properly from the start.
 *
 * The correct way to guarantee aspect coverage is to ensure that every segment
 * of N cards (where N = number of slots filled from this belt) contains the
 * required aspects. This is handled during belt construction, not after pack generation.
 *
 * STATIC ASSIGNMENTS:
 * Each set has a predefined list of cards assigned to Belt A or Belt B.
 * See src/belts/data/commonBeltAssignments.js for the mappings.
 *
 * BLOCK-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR:
 *
 * Block 0 (Sets 1-3: SOR, SHD, TWI):
 * - Belt A: 60 cards (Vigilance, Command, Aggression) → fills slots 1-6
 *   CONSTRAINT: Every segment of 6 cards has at least 1 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Red
 * - Belt B: 30 cards (Cunning, Villainy, Heroism, Neutral) → fills slots 7-9
 *   CONSTRAINT: Every segment of 3 cards has at least 1 Yellow
 *
 * Block A (Sets 4-6: JTL, LOF, SEC):
 * - Belt A: 50 cards (Vigilance, Command, Villainy) → fills slots 1-4
 *   CONSTRAINT: Every segment of 4 cards has at least 1 Blue, 1 Green
 * - Belt B: 50 cards (Aggression, Cunning, Heroism, Neutral) → fills slots 6-9
 *   CONSTRAINT: Every segment of 4 cards has at least 1 Red, 1 Yellow
 *
 * DUPLICATE PREVENTION:
 * - 12-card deduplication window prevents same card appearing close together
 * - Seam deduplication ensures no duplicates at boot boundaries
