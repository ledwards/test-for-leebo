# Release Notes

## 03.01.2026

### 🎉 New Features
- **Carbonite Booster Packs**: Premium all-variant packs for Sets 4-7 (JTL, LOF, SEC, LAW). Every card is a foil, hyperspace, prestige, or showcase variant. Pre-LAW packs have rarity-specific foil and hyperspace slots; LAW packs use weighted mixed-rarity hyperspace. Each pack includes a guaranteed prestige card and a hyperspace leader (with a chance of showcase upgrade). Selectable in Chaos Sealed and Chaos Draft.
- **Pod chat persistence via Discord**: Chat messages in public pods are now persisted through Discord threads. Navigate between lobby, draft, deckbuilder, and play pages without losing chat history. Private pods still have live real-time chat, but no history persistence.
- **Discord thread lifecycle on visibility toggle**: Toggling a pod from private to public now automatically creates the Discord announcement embed and chat thread. Toggling back to private cleans up the Discord embed.
- **Private pod chat notice**: Private pods show a notice explaining that chat history is live-only, with a "Make Pod Public" button for the host.
- **Prestige tier system**: Carbonite prestige cards now use tier1/tier2/serialized naming. Tier 2 and serialized get the foil visual treatment.
- **Chaos Sealed/Draft improvements**: Pack count now goes up to 12 (was 10), selections persist across page refreshes, and pack names are more compact for large selections.

### 📦 Pack Generation
- **LAW pack structure update**: Slot 5 is now a dedicated Hyperspace common from its own belt (equal distribution across all HS commons). The other 8 common slots no longer upgrade to Hyperspace. UC3 can now upgrade to Prestige tier 1 (~1/18 rate, checked before HS R/L fallback). The rare/legendary slot can no longer upgrade.

### 🎮 Game Modes/Gameplay
- **Pod play instructions**: Play instructions in draft and sealed pods now reference your specific opponent and podmates instead of generic "find an opponent" language. Added a 4th step about organizing future pod pairings.
- **Pod organizer crown**: The pod organizer is now indicated with a crown icon next to their name in the player list on pod play pages.
- **Public/Private pod toggle on set selection**: The visibility toggle now appears inline below the "Select a Set" heading on both draft and sealed creation pages, reads "Public Pod" / "Private Pod", and remembers your preference across sessions.
- **Pod status visible to all players**: The player list on pod play pages is now visible to all players, not just the host. Host-only controls (like viewing other players' decks) remain host-only.
- **Sequential player numbering**: Players in the pod list now show sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...) instead of internal seat numbers.
- **Player readiness tracking**: Players who have finished deckbuilding and navigated to the play page now correctly show as "Ready" instead of "Deckbuilding".
- **System messages in web chat**: Pod events (join, leave, start, rename) now appear as system messages in the web chat panel, not just on Discord.
- **Discord thread deep link**: Clicking the "Pod Chat (public)" header now opens the Discord thread directly in the Discord app.
- **Hide Discord banner for members**: The "Join the Community" Discord banner on pod play pages is now hidden for users who are already Discord members.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **Pack opening display fix**: Carbonite pack opening animation now correctly sizes prestige cards as portrait instead of incorrectly rendering them as landscape.
- **Open All button in desktop carousel**: Fixed the "Open All" button being unclickable when many packs triggered the desktop carousel layout.
- **Practice hand wider layout**: Practice hand modal is now wider, giving cards more room to spread out.
- **Auto-rejoin bug**: Fixed a bug where leaving a pod would immediately re-add the player due to the auto-join logic firing.
- **Deck builder loading state**: The deck builder no longer shows misleading action buttons while loading. Removed "Login to Clone" text in favor of just "Clone".
- **Consistent status labels**: Unified player status labels to "Deckbuilding" and "Ready" everywhere (was inconsistent between different views).

## 02.28.2026

### 🎮 Game Modes/Gameplay
- **Draft Pod and Sealed Pod pages**: Draft and Sealed pod modes now have dedicated landing pages with create, join, and history sections. Solo modes show "Solo Draft" and "Solo Sealed" titles.
- **Draft table visibility restored**: During leader draft, all players can now see each other's available leader packs again (simulating a physical table). Pack card counts are also visible for all players during the draft.
- **Host controls improvements**: Public/private visibility toggle, configurable round timer and last-player timer durations, and reorganized button layout.

### 🎉 New Features
- **Copy Deck Link for all users**: The "Copy Link" button on the Play page is now available to everyone, not just beta testers. Paste your deck link directly into Karabast to play your drafted or sealed deck online.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **Empty draft packs fix**: Fixed a bug where draft pods could be created with empty packs if the card cache wasn't initialized. Card cache now self-initializes on first access, preventing silent empty results.

## 02.27.2026

### 📦 Pack Generation
- **LAW foil position**: In LAW packs, the Hyperspace Foil card now sits between the commons and uncommons (index 11), matching real-world pack collation. Sets 1-6 are unchanged.
- **Special rarity in UC3 upgrades**: For sets 4+ (JTL, LOF, SEC, LAW), Special rarity cards can now appear when the 3rd uncommon slot upgrades to a Hyperspace rare/legendary. Specials appear at the same per-card frequency as rares.

### 🎮 Game Modes/Gameplay
- **Spread seating**: Players joining a draft or sealed pod are now seated to maximize distance from existing players around the circular table, rather than filling seats sequentially. This improves fairness in pack passing for partially-filled pods.

## 02.26.2026

### 🎉 New Features
- **Solo and Pod modes**: The homepage now separtes into Solo and Pod modes. Use Solo to rpactice by yourself, or to make Limited format decks that you can play against someone later. Use Pod Play to join an existing Draft or Sealed Pod listed publicly on the site, or to start a private pod with your friends.
- **Sealed pods**: You can now start a Sealed Pod. Just like a Draft Pod, but sealed!
- **Draft logs**: You can now see your Draft picks in order after the fact to help improve your draft picking. These default to private, but can be made public by clicking the lock icon so you can share with friends and teammates for feedback.
- **Stats overhaul**: Stats is now focused on competitive data based on anonymized, aggregate data collection. Pack quality metrics are moved to the QA page.
- **Public API**: A very early API supports these statsand also exporting your personal data. Documentation at [https://www.protectthepod.com/api](https://www.protectthepod.com/api)

### 📦 Pack Generation
- **Foil legendary rate fixed**: Fixed foil slot over-representing legendary cards. 

### 📊 Stats & Quality
- **Duplicate metrics split by format**: Duplicate/triplicate tracking now separates sealed pools (6 packs per pool) from draft (3 packs per player). Previously draft data was mixed into sealed expectations, producing extreme z-scores. Sealed groups by pool, draft groups by the 3 packs each player opens. Both display separately on the QA page.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **Card preview on hover not working in Draft**: Fixed a bug where the enlarged card preview on hover was broken for some Chrome desktop users during the draft picking phase.

### 📝 Terms of Service
- **No tournaments allowed** We want to make clear that Protect the Pod exists to support the Star War Unlimited limited scene, not replace it. Tournaments are not allowed on the platform, which is intended purely for competitve practice and fun casual formats. More information about this rule on the Discord.

## 02.24.2026

### 🎉 New Features
- **Karabast deck source integration**: Added a deck.json API endpoint for compatibility with Karabast and other SWU tools. A companion PR has been submitted to the Karabast project to add Protect the Pod as a supported deck source.
- **Copy Deck Link on Play page**: Copy your deck link directly from the Play page to paste into Karabast.
- **Play page improvements**: Updated instructions with Discord link for finding opponents.
- **Card preview on iPad**: Tap any card on iPad to see an enlarged preview. Tap anywhere outside the card to dismiss. (Phones still use long-press.)

### 🔒 Security
- **Leader draft pack visibility**: During the leader draft phase, other players' available leader packs were visible via network inspection (browser DevTools). Leader packs are now only sent to the owning player, preventing opponents from seeing what leaders are available to other drafters.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **Sticky nav bar positioning fix**: Fixed a rare bug where the deck builder's sticky navigation bar could appear in the middle of the page with blur overlay covering content. Caused by CSS `will-change: transform` interfering with `position: sticky` during view mode transitions.

## 02.23.2026

### 📦 Pack Generation
- **Rare slot never upgrades to Hyperspace**: Fixed incorrect behavior where rares/legendaries in the rare slot (index 14) could upgrade to Hyperspace variants. Per real-world TCG collation, the rare slot card is ALWAYS the Normal variant. Hyperspace rares/legendaries only appear via UC3 upgrade (3rd uncommon slot → random HS R/L from belt). This affects all sets 1-7.

### 🎉 New Features
- **Practice Hand**: On the Play page, click "Practice Hand" to draw 6 random cards from your deck and see what your opening hand might look like. Click "Draw Another" to shuffle and draw again. Shows the probability of drawing at least one turn-one play and the average number of turn-one plays in your opening hand, accounting for aspect penalties from your leader and base.

### 💽 Data Changes
- **Built deck tracking**: Added database tracking for when users play decks from pools. This data will help analyze pool-to-deck conversion patterns and improve pack generation quality metrics.

## 02.19.2026

### 📦 Pack Generation
- **LAW rare bases fixed**: Rare bases in LAW now correctly appear in the rare/legendary slot, same as all previous sets. Previously they were incorrectly placed in the base slot.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **Deck name no longer grows infinitely**: Fixed a bug where switching leaders/bases kept appending to the deck name (e.g., "SEC Sealed (Jabba Green) (Jabba Green) (Lama Su Green)..."). Names now correctly replace the leader/base suffix. Dates removed from default names for cleaner display.
- **Deck names capped at 80 characters**: SWUDB rejects names over 80 chars, so we now enforce this limit in the UI and truncate in all export paths.
- **Deck export variant fix**: Hyperspace and Foil cards now correctly export as their Normal variant IDs for SWUDB/Karabast compatibility. Also fixed Chaos Sealed exports not building the variant map across all selected sets.

## 02.18.2026
This is a big one. I'm proud to get this live within just a few hours of the full set being spoiled, including major changes to how packs are made (no regular foils, guaranteed hyperspace per pack) and how aspect filters need to work from a UI design perspective to accommodate multi-aspect cards.

One of the big use cases here will be practicing for pre-release, so we also added the ability to put hyperspace leaders into your sealed pools.

Finally: Hope to see some of you at the largest U.S. SWU Limited event in Milwaukee, WI this weekend!

### 🎉 New Features
- **A Lawless Time (LAW) Now Live**: Set 7 is now available for all users! Pre-release disclaimer shown during pack opening notes that collation is our best guess until we have more real-world data.
- **Starter Leaders**: In the deck builder, click "+ Starter Leaders" next to the Leaders header to add the Hyperspace versions of the set's starter deck leaders to your pool. Great for practicing with the pre-release leaders in sealed!
- **Shuffle Packs**: New button in sealed and draft lobby to shuffle which packs you receive from a simulated 24-pack booster box. Just like cracking a real box, you can now randomize your position in the box before opening your packs. This matters, becuase the way TCG packs and boxes are collated in real life invovles some amount of patterning that reduces variance. Shuffling packs increases variance, and shoudl result in more duplicates and triplicates in sealed pools. We will be collecting data as people use this feature to see how it affects statistical distributions.
  - Sealed: Click "Shuffle Packs" before opening to get a random selection of 6 packs from the 24-pack box
  - Draft: Host can shuffle packs in the lobby before starting

## 02.15.2026

### 🌀 Chaos Mode Improvements
- **Chaos Sealed open access**: Chaos Sealed no longer requires authentication. Jump right in without logging in, select your 6 packs, and start building!
- **Full base selection**: Chaos draft and chaos sealed now show deduplicated common bases from ALL selected sets, not just the primary set. For example, a 6-set chaos pool now shows 8 common bases (4 aspects × 2 HP tiers) instead of only 4 from one set.

### 🔐 Draft Authentication
- **Friendly auth flow**: Draft modes (including Chaos Draft) now show helpful login prompts instead of dead-end errors. Click "Login with Discord" and you'll be redirected right back to continue where you left off.
- **Why drafts need login**: Multiplayer drafts require Discord login to track players, but we've made the process seamless.

### 📦 Pack Generation Quality Fixes
Stats page caught three issues in production data - fixed them all:

- **Same-treatment duplicates eliminated**: Added final deduplication pass after variant upgrades to catch edge cases where the same card+variant+foil appeared twice in a pack. Previously 13/876 packs had this issue, now 0.
- **Hyperspace common rate fixed**: Hyperspace common upgrades now always succeed. Previously some upgrades failed silently when variant card data was missing (~2.3% observed vs 3.7% expected).
- **Foil rarity distribution fixed**: Foil slot now targets correct percentages (Common ~75%, Uncommon ~17%, Rare ~5%) by dynamically calculating weights based on actual card pool sizes. Previously Uncommon was underrepresented (11.6% vs 17% expected).

## 02.14.2026

### 📦 Pack Generation Quality Fix
Stats page is doing its job, alerting me to anomalies in pack generation so I can fix them!

- **Legendary rate fixed**: Fixed a critical collation error where legendary cards sometimes did not appear at their correct rates of 12.5% (Sets 1-3) and 16.7% (Sets 4-6).
- **Hyperspace R/L rate fixed**: Same bug existed on hyperspace belts - now produces correct hyperspace legendary rates.
- **Deduplication improved**: Added full-segment deduplication to prevent same base treatment cards from appearing within 6 slots of each other in rare cases.

### 📊 Stats & Quality
- **Duplicate/triplicate analysis**: Stats page now shows duplicate and triplicate distribution metrics per set. Tracks both "base treatment" (Normal variants only) and "any treatment" (exact card matches). Values are compared against expected statistical baselines using z-score validation.
- **QA tests expanded**: Added statistical tests for duplicate/triplicate rates with per-set expected values derived from baseline analysis of 500 pods per set.

## 02.13.2026

### 🎉 New Features
- **Swag store**: Added "Shop the Merch" link on the About page — check out the official Protect the Pod merch at swag.protectthepod.com!
- **Multi-primary aspect filters**: Arena view now supports LAW set cards with multiple primary aspects (e.g., Aggression+Command). These appear as compact filter buttons below the standard combos in each aspect group. Iterating on this design to get it right before the release of A Lawless Time.
- **Other formats**: New other formats (Chaos Draft and Chaos Sealed) — build a sealed pool from any 6 packs across any combination of sets! We are urrently also testing Pack Wars and Rotisserie Draft!

### 👕 Swag Store
- **Swag store**: If you love us enough to rep us on your chest, head, back, or hands, check out the swag store at swag.protectthepod.com provided by Fourthwall!

### 🎨 UI Improvements
- **Mobile landscape**: Arena mode now works on phones turned sideways! Cost columns wrap into two rows of four. Nav bar compresses to a single row. Unfortuntely this just doesn't fit in portrait mode, so it won't be supported there.
- **Arena deck sorting**: Cards in cost columns now sort by cost, then aspect color order, then alphabetically (instead of just alphabetical).
- **Error pages**: Nice little easter egg in the error pages for anyone old enough to remember Twitter's failwhale.

### 📦 Pack Generation
- **Foil rarity weights**: Fixed foil slot weights to match actual belt output. Special rarity foils in sets 4-6 now correctly appear at the same rate as Rare foils.
- **Hyperfoil tracking**: Fixed hyperfoil cards being tracked as regular foils instead of hyperspace foils.
- **Slot type accuracy**: Sealed packs now use position-based slot types for tracking, so uncommon-to-rare upgrades don't inflate rare slot statistics.

### 📊 Stats & Quality
- **Stats page**: www.protectthepod.com/stats shows information about the current statistical state of the pod. Quality metrics include foil rate, hyperfoil rate, and showcase leader rate, pack structure, distribution, and more. The stats page should help build confidence around the quality of pack generations.
- Added QA tests for legendary rate, hyperfoil rate, showcase leader rate, and more (185 total QA tests)

## 02.11.2026

### 🎉 New Features
- **Other Formats (Beta)**: New alternative limited formats for beta testers! Includes Chaos Draft, Rotisserie Draft, Pack Wars, and Pack Blitz. More details coming as each mode is implemented.

### 🎁 Patreon
- Some of you have asked about how to support Protect the Pod and I want be clear that the site is free to use. That being said, it does cost me a bit of money every month to host, as well as tokens to develop, so I certainly won't say no to help offsetting the cost! You can support Protect the Pod via [Patreon](https://patreon.com/ProtectthePod) with my thanks!
- We also have an about page now with shoutouts to my teammates.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

- **Pool Image Export**: When viewing a deck image, click "Show Pool" to generate a full pool image showing your deck, other leaders, rare bases, and remaining pool cards. Great for sharing your sealed pool with friends.

## 02.06.2026

## 02.01.2026

### 📦 Pack Generation
- **Incorporated results from data collection efforts**: Thanks to the Discord community for their contributions, we now fill the common slots in booster packs in a way much more closely resembling physical packs.
- **Improved belt refill**: Updated the way belts refill themselves from printer sheets to ensure constraints across the "seams". End result is 100% compliance with collation rules such as distance between duplicates and aspect diversity.

### 🔧 Maintenance
- Added comprehensive QA tests for seam-aware belt behavior
- Documentation audit: Improved documentation for code generation agents

### 🤖 AI Players
- Added list of most powerful cards in the SEC limited format based on great videos by wooooo and Thorkk. Drafting bots will favor these powerful cards in their aspects.

- ## 01.31.2026

## 01.30.2026

### 🎉 New Features
- Fancy pack opening animation that makes the app look like it's professional 😉

### 💽 Data Changes
- Hyperspace Foil variants now properly appear in booster packs at ~1/50 rate
- Improved variant downgrade for deck exports (foil/hyperspace cards correctly map to base versions)
- Not pleased with data quality I was getting from third party sources, so I made my own api that directly sources starwarsunlimited.com, launched that too, and am consuming it here now. This should also help with adding LAW as soon as possible.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

- More reliably save deck state during deckbuilder if you leave the page or refresh
- Fix deck image export on Chrome
- Fix bug that sometimes made a deck appear empty
