# Pack Generation Documentation

This document describes how booster packs are generated.

## Pack Structure

Each booster pack contains 16 cards:

| Slot | Card Type | Count |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Leader | 1 |
| 2 | Base | 1 |
| 3-11 | Commons | 9 |
| 12-14 | Uncommons | 3 |
| 15 | Rare/Legendary | 1 |
| 16 | Foil | 1 |

## Common Slot Distribution

Commons are drawn from two belts (A and B) based on the set's block.

### Block 0 (SOR, SHD, TWI)

```
Slot 1: Belt A
Slot 2: Belt A
Slot 3: Belt A
Slot 4: Belt A
Slot 5: Belt A
Slot 6: Belt A  ← Hyperspace upgrade slot
Slot 7: Belt B
Slot 8: Belt B
Slot 9: Belt B
```

### Block A (JTL, LOF, SEC)

```
Slot 1: Belt A
Slot 2: Belt A
Slot 3: Belt A
Slot 4: Belt A  ← Hyperspace upgrade slot
Slot 5: Alternates (A or B each pack)
Slot 6: Belt B
Slot 7: Belt B
Slot 8: Belt B
Slot 9: Belt B
```

## Upgrade System

After the base pack is assembled, an upgrade pass may modify certain slots based on probabilities.

### Upgrade Types

| Upgrade | Description | Probability Source |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Leader → Showcase | Find showcase variant of same leader | `leaderToShowcase` |
| Leader → Hyperspace | Find HS variant of same leader | `leaderToHyperspace` |
| Base → Hyperspace | Find HS variant of same base | `baseToHyperspace` |
| Rare → Hyperspace | Find HS variant of same rare | `rareToHyperspaceRL` |
| Foil → Hyperfoil | Draw random HS foil | `foilToHyperfoil` |
| UC1 → HS Uncommon | Find HS variant of 1st uncommon | `firstUCToHyperspaceUC` |
| UC2 → HS Uncommon | Find HS variant of 2nd uncommon | `secondUCToHyperspaceUC` |
| UC3 → HS Rare/Legendary | Draw random HS R/L | `thirdUCToHyperspaceRL` |
| Common → Hyperspace | Find HS variant of common in slot | `commonToHyperspace` |

### Common Hyperspace Upgrade

The common hyperspace upgrade works differently from other upgrades:

1. **Fixed Slot**: The upgrade always happens at a specific slot
   - Block 0: Slot 6
   - Block A: Slot 4

2. **Variant of Existing Card**: We find the hyperspace variant of the card that's already in that slot, NOT a random hyperspace card

3. **No Belt Pull**: We don't pull from a hyperspace common belt

This ensures the hyperspace card is a variant of something that was "supposed to be there" based on the belt system.

## Aspect Coverage

The belt system guarantees aspect coverage through proper manufacturing, not post-hoc fixes.

### Manufacturing Principle

We mimic a physical card manufacturing process. The belt is a cyclic conveyor
that dispenses cards in order. We do NOT use post-hoc fixes or manual corrections.
Instead, we ensure the belt is constructed properly from the start.

The correct way to guarantee aspect coverage is to ensure that every segment
of N cards (where N = number of slots filled from this belt) contains the
required aspects. This is handled during belt construction, not after pack generation.

### Block 0 (Sets 1-3)
- Belt A (60 cards, fills slots 1-6): Every segment of 6 cards has at least 1 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Red
- Belt B (30 cards, fills slots 7-9): Every segment of 3 cards has at least 1 Yellow
- Combined: All basic aspects (B, G, R, Y) guaranteed in every pack

### Block A (Sets 4-6)
- Belt A (50 cards, fills slots 1-4): Every segment of 4 cards has at least 1 Blue, 1 Green
- Belt B (50 cards, fills slots 6-9): Every segment of 4 cards has at least 1 Red, 1 Yellow
- Combined: All basic aspects (B, G, R, Y) guaranteed in every pack

### Algorithm

The belt construction algorithm:
1. Categorizes cards by their aspect coverage (single-aspect, multi-aspect, other)
2. Evenly distributes aspect cards across the belt
3. Fills remaining slots with other cards
4. Shuffles for randomness while maintaining aspect spacing

### Seam-Aware Refill

When a belt refills, we use seam-aware construction to maintain aspect coverage across boot boundaries:

1. **Refill threshold**: Belt refills when it has exactly `drawSize` cards left
2. **Seam analysis**: The remaining cards (seam cards) are analyzed for their aspects
3. **Complementary construction**: New boot's first positions get cards with aspects missing from seam
4. **Result**: Any draw spanning the seam still satisfies aspect constraints

This ensures 100% aspect coverage even after many refill cycles.

See `docs/BELTS.md` for detailed seam-aware refill documentation.

## Sealed Pod Generation

A sealed pod consists of 6 booster packs:

```javascript
generateSealedPod(cards, setCode, packCount = 6)
```

Key behaviors:
1. Belt cache is cleared before generating a pod
2. This ensures each sealed pool starts with a fresh belt state
3. Packs are generated sequentially, with belts advancing between packs

## Configuration

Pack generation constants are in:
```
src/utils/packConstants.js
```

Set-specific configurations are in:
```
src/utils/setConfigs/
```

## Testing

Pack tests are in:
- `src/utils/boosterPack.test.js` - Unit tests
- `src/qa/packGeneration.test.js` - Statistical QA tests

Key test scenarios:
- All packs have exactly 16 cards
- No duplicate base treatment cards within a pack
- Aspect coverage validation
- Hyperspace upgrade rates
- Card variety distribution

## Known Learnings

### From Physical Box Opens

1. **Belt Sizes**: Block 0 uses 60/30 split, Block A uses 50/50 split
2. **Slot Patterns**: Physical packs follow consistent slot-to-belt patterns
3. **Hyperspace Slots**: Fixed slots for hyperspace upgrades (not random)
4. **Alternating Slot**: Block A slot 5 alternates between belts

### Edge Cases

1. **Small Belt**: If belt is smaller than dedup window, cards may appear closer together
2. **Missing Cards**: If a card name in assignments doesn't match the database, it's skipped with a warning
3. **Aspect Coverage**: Rare cases where all cards of an aspect are already in the pack - skip the fix rather than create duplicates
